# RealTimeProject
This is the group for the project of Real Time Programming.

Some ideas:

1. Stress control for driving behaviour controller system.

Use a smartwatch or something that can measure the heartbeat rate from a driver and decide if he is stressed or not. Then, the system can decide how to warn the driver (think about different ways of warning or reduce the stress of the user)


## System Configuration
  
- SODIAL(R) Pulse Sensor can measure ECG by touching finger.

-  The sensor is built in steering wheel like below.

- When driver grabs the part of wheel, the sensor measures ECG. 

- SODIAL(R) Pulse Sensor is connected with A/D converter and this converter sends digital data to Raspberry Pi.

2. Diabetes and Driving

- Current Limitation 
 1) Only can measure transient blood sugar 
 
 2) Blood-gathering method 
 
 3) Expesive sensor price 
 

3. Driver Attention Lose Control
